    <h1>The Process</h1>
    <p>Tech in space is extremely important today. From sattelites to spaceships, advancing in space tech is the next step in the development of human society. There are various ingenius ideas in the world and with time many of them will become reality. I decided to write about tech in space because technology in space is very important to figuring out how and why we exist. I was deciding between two topics; one being education and the other one being space. I chose space because it is more interesting to me than education.
      <br>
      There are many cool things about space, and a cool website that I have found is actually NASA’s public API. NASA was nice enough to give the public information that they have found, about space.
      <br>
      This was a major deciding factor in what topic I was going to choose because the fact that NASA is giving us free information about space was mind blowing to me. Making a website built around NASA’s very own API was something that I couldn’t pass up. As I already know a lot about HTML and CSS I have already started to code my website. Using my prior knowledge of HTML and CSS I was able to create this and even expanded my knowledge.
      <br>
      Throughout the creation of my website, I learned more about coding and I think that for my level of skill, and how old I am, this is very impressive. If there was a certain skill that I have expanded upon the most it would be using Google. You have to use the internet to your advantage when coding because there is simply too much information to remember.
      <br>
      My website works by taking information from NASA themselves and displaying it on screen using Javascript. I am still working on it and there are a lot of bugs but eventually I will get everything working. Right now I think you could say that it is at an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage.

  <h1>Tech in Space: The Gravity Offset Table</h1>

      <p>I have gotten a great amount of information about my topic, tech in space. I have to say, searching this information up has been a blast. I learned about many different machines and technology that I would be glad to educate the reader with. One of these machines was the gravity offset table. This machine allows the user to simulate zero-gravity conditions but on Earth. The most common use is to test space payloads. This website goes into depth on the topic of gravity offset tables. But to sum everything up in a couple of sentences, a gravity offset table is a very large piece of granite measuring 8 feet by 10 feet, weighing 8.5 tons. Three air bearings release air from a pressurized source that simulates floating. This technology is very interesting and can be very useful testing how things float. One software application that I find very interesting is called Planets. This app can tell you what planets and stars you are looking at just by pointing your phone upwards. Both the Planets and the Gravity Offset Table are very advanced pieces of technology that people should know about and be educated on.
